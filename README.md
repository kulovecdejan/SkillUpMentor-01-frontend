<p align="left">This project is a full-stack auction web application that allows users to create and manage auction events. Registered users can create auction events by providing images, event titles, descriptions, starting prices, and auction durations. Bidders can participate in auctions, place bids, and monitor the status of their bids. Bids are incrementally increased until they reach the bidder's specified maximum bid. At the end of the auction period, the highest bid wins the item. Sellers have the capability to manage their auction events and view bidding histories.</p>
